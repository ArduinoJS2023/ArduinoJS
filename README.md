This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First,run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

**The Arduino - JavaScript Robotics & Machines Programming Framework**
![WhatsApp Image 2023-06-20 at 09 12 21](https://github.com/ArduinoJS2023/ArduinoJS/assets/136968157/a7107b33-e52b-4829-be57-8499d32efd56)

_ArduinoJS is an Open Source, Firmata Protocol based, Robotics and Machines programming framework, developed by inteRFace.
Just interested in learning and building awesome things? You might want to start with the [official website](ArduinoJS.com)._

## ArduinoJS
ArduinoJS is a bridge between the world of web full stack development and Arduino. With ArduinoJS, you can skip C++ coding and design cutting-edge interfaces for your Arduino projects. Leverage the power of modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks with your Arduino hardware.

## Features
Interact with your Arduino using advanced web technologies.
Use the power of advancedfirmata, node.js, jonny-five, and next.js without having to delve into C++ programming.
Contribute to a growing open-source community creating high-level use case projects.
Installation
Here are some keywords to get you started on the setup process: Arduino: advancedfirmata, JS: node.js, jonny-five, Frimwork: next.js.

## Examples
Stay tuned! The ArduinoJS community is actively working on some cool high-level use case projects. We will update this space as soon as we have some exciting projects to share.

## Applications
Used in underwater sensors, drones, ATMs, fork lift diagnostics, and medical devices. ArduinoJS has found its way into many industries. With an Open Source MIT license and the ability to submit fixes back to the project, ArduinoJS is an obvious choice for your next project.

## Consumer Devices
ArduinoJS is used in consumer devices ranging from IOT Devices, robots and machines.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from everyone! Feel free to contribute code, documentation, bug reports, or anything else you think could improve ArduinoJS.

## Contact
